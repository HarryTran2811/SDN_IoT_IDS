# SDN-Dataset

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and processing the SDN IoT dataset. The dataset contains various IoT device data, which is used to study and develop models for network traffic analysis and anomaly detection.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is located in the `dataset/SDN_IoT-Dataset` directory. It contains multiple CSV files, each representing different IoT devices and their network traffic data.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDN-Dataset.git
    cd SDN-Dataset
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
